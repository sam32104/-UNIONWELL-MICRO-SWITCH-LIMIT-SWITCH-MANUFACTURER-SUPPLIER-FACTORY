MICRO SWITCH LIMIT SWITCH MANUFACTURER</a>		

The microswitch is a switch that is used in electronics, to interrupt or divert currents of small intensity: this is what a microswitch is .  It is also called a micro switch because the contact distance of the switch is quite small. It is, in fact, a type of switch with a contact mechanism that is covered by a shell and has a control bar outside the switch itself. A minimum force is required to operate a microswitch.
The microswitch is a solution that has been designed to control the movement of a mechanical part and is used in appliances, electronic equipment, automatic machines and electric cars. The market offers different types of microswitches that can be easily adapted to different equipment and different needs. You will not have trouble finding the one that's right for you.

On the market you can find different types of microswitches:
Watertight microswitch
The watertight microswitch is located inside the gas water heater, different from the instant electric water heater , and is a kind of quick switch that is activated by pressure and is also called a sensitive switch . This microswitch consists of a small connecting shaft, a bracket, a microswitch body and a shift fork. How does it work? The external mechanical force exerts a force on the increase of the action through the transmission element which can be a wifi  or traditional electrical socket , a button or a lever. The microswitch has a small contact distance, a short stroke, a small power and a quick ignition.
Slide microswitch
The slide switch is used to control the flow of current in a circuit and uses a mechanical slider to switch the current on and off. It is suitable for current flow control in small circuits, it is easy to see it used as a power switch in small battery powered electrical devices. It works similar to a push button switch, however it has a more noticeable shape to the touch, which allows the user to switch between the on and off states more easily .
12v microswitch
The 12v microswitch is useful for controlling the switching on or off of different types of circuits. It can be applied to cars, engines, water dispensers and many other equipment. Different models of this type of microswitches can be found on the market:
•	take it,
•	push-button,
•	with LED light,
•	in steel.
Surely you can easily buy the solution that suits you best.
